Windows setup, avoid copying the linux folder as it would be useless. Linux instructions in that folder.

Deus Exe:

Just drag the contents of the zip file into your Deus Ex "system" folder. Should be located in steam/steamapps/common/deus ex OR wherever you installed the game from GOG/disc.

Unreal Engine Direct3D 10 Renderer:
https://kentie.net/article/d3d10drv/
Unzip the files into your "system" folder from the previous step, launch the game through Deus Exe/Kentie's Launcher, set renderer as "Direct 3D 10 Support"

Enabling Classic Lighting (Highly recommended)

Press T on your keyboard while ingame, erase "say" and type "preferences" then hit enter. A window full of options will open up, click "rendering" then "Direct3D 10 Support". Find the box that says "Classic Lighting" and change the option from "False" to "True", then click out of the window. Your game should revert back to Ion Storm's original lighting engine.
